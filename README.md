# Heart Failure Risk Analysis

This project analyzes heart failure risk using patient medical data. It provides insights through data visualization, statistical analysis, and classification models to predict heart failure outcomes.

## Project Overview

# Heart Failure Unveiled: Delving into the Core Risks  

### What is Heart Failure?

**Heart failure is a medical condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to insufficient blood flow to meet the body's needs.**

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Risk factor analysis for heart failure
- Machine learning models for prediction
- Evaluation metrics for model performance

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and ensure the necessary libraries are installed.
2. Make sure you've downloaded the dataset.  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the analysis workflow.  
4. Run each section sequentially to reproduce the results.  

## Results and Insights

**The presented visualization is a Correlation Heatmap, offering insights into the relationships between various categorized data pairs within the dataset.**

**The color gradient visually represents the strength and direction of these correlations, aiding in the identification of patterns and dependencies within the dataset.**

This project is for educational purposes and open for collaboration.
